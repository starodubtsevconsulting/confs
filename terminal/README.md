# Terminal setup

This folder contains the terminal and shell setup for Ubuntu.

What it gives you:
- zsh as the default interactive shell
- autosuggestions and syntax highlighting
- fzf keybindings and completion
- a clean powerline-style prompt with git branch info
- nicer defaults for `ls` (eza) and `cat` (bat)

Why you need it:
- faster navigation and completion
- clearer prompts and git context
- consistent, repeatable terminal experience on fresh installs

Run:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Note: setup may update `~/.profile` and `~/.zshrc` for PATH defaults.
